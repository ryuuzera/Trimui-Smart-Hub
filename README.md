## Technology Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **C#**  
  The primary programming language used for developing the application, providing powerful features and performance to handle complex tasks.

- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**  
  Used for creating the application's graphical user interface (GUI). WPF allows for a modern and responsive UI design with rich controls, animations, and a highly customizable look and feel.

- **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)**  
  Used for system management tasks, such as detecting USB devices and interacting with the system hardware. WMI helps the Hub automatically recognize Trimui devices and manage interactions with the connected hardware.

- **JSON Parsing**  
  The application reads and processes JSON data, particularly when scraping metadata like game thumbnails from LibRetro. This allows the Hub to dynamically fetch and display information about games and emulators.

- **Web Scraping**  
  Used to retrieve game thumbnails and metadata from external sources like LibRetro, providing users with an enhanced visual experience for their game libraries.

## Future Plans

- Enhanced ROM management features, including bulk uploads and automatic organization.
- Advanced settings for fine-tuning emulator performance and custom configurations.
- Integrated community features, including sharing game collections and emulator settings with other users.
